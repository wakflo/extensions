# Ghost Integration

## Description

Ghost is a powerful open-source publishing platform that enables creators to build and manage modern online publications. This integration allows you to automate your Ghost CMS workflows, including:

* Create, update, and manage posts and pages programmatically
* Manage members and subscriptions for your publication
* Organize content with tags and authors
* Monitor publication activity with real-time triggers
* Upload and manage media assets
* Synchronize content across multiple platforms
* Automate newsletter distribution and member management

## Prerequisites

* A Ghost publication (self-hosted or Ghost(Pro))
* Admin API integration with Admin API Key
* The latest version of Ghost (v5.0 or higher recommended)
* Your Ghost site URL

## Setup Instructions

1. **Access Ghost Admin Panel**
   - Log in to your Ghost Admin panel at `https://yourblog.ghost.io/ghost`
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Integrations

2. **Create Custom Integration**
   - Click "Add custom integration"
   - Give your integration a name (e.g., "Wakflo Integration")
   - Ghost will generate an Admin API Key

3. **Copy Integration Details**
   - Copy the Admin API Key (format: `site-name:key`)
   - Note your Ghost site URL (e.g., `https://yourblog.ghost.io`)

4. **Configure in Wakflo**
   - Go to the Integrations section in Wakflo
   - Select "Ghost" from the available integrations
   - Enter your Ghost site URL
   - Enter the Admin API Key from step 3
   - Click "Connect" to establish the connection

5. **Test the Connection**
   - Try creating a test post or listing existing posts
   - Verify that the integration is working correctly

## Authentication

This integration uses Ghost's Admin API authentication with JWT tokens. The Admin API Key provides full access to create, edit, and delete content in your Ghost publication.

### Authentication Process
1. The integration splits the Admin API key into ID and secret
2. Creates a JWT token signed with the secret
3. Includes the token in the Authorization header for all requests
4. Tokens expire after 5 minutes and are regenerated automatically

## API Version

This integration uses Ghost Admin API v5.0 for maximum compatibility and feature support.

## Rate Limits

Ghost API has the following rate limits:
* **Admin API**: 120 requests per minute
* **Content API**: 300 requests per minute (not used in this integration)

The integration handles rate limiting automatically and will retry failed requests when appropriate.

## Content Formats

Ghost supports multiple content formats:

### HTML
Standard HTML content for posts and pages.

### Markdown
Write content in Markdown format, automatically converted to HTML.

### Lexical
Ghost's new rich text editor format (recommended for Ghost 5.0+).

## Error Handling

The integration provides detailed error messages for common issues:
* Invalid API key format
* Unauthorized access (expired or invalid key)
* Post/Page not found
* Validation errors (missing required fields)
* Rate limit exceeded

## Webhooks Support

While this integration primarily uses polling for triggers, Ghost also supports webhooks for real-time events. Contact support if you need webhook-based triggers.
