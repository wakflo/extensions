# Calculator Integration

## Description

Automate calculations and data manipulation with our Calculator integration. Seamlessly connect your calculator to your workflow, allowing you to perform complex mathematical operations, convert units, and more - all within the context of your automated process.

**Calculator Integration Documentation**

**Overview**
The Calculator integration allows you to automate calculations and mathematical operations within your workflow. This integration enables you to perform complex calculations, convert units, and perform statistical analysis, all within the context of your automated workflow.

**Features**

* Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
* Convert between different units of measurement (length, weight, temperature, etc.)
* Calculate statistical measures (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.)
* Support for advanced mathematical functions (trigonometry, logarithms, exponentials, etc.)

**Setup**

1. Install the Calculator integration by searching for "Calculator" in the integrations marketplace.
2. Configure the integration by specifying the calculation type and any necessary input parameters.

**Usage**

1. Use the Calculator integration as a node within your workflow to perform calculations on data.
2. Pass input values to the integration using the "Input" parameter.
3. Specify the calculation type and any necessary options (e.g., unit conversion).
4. The integration will return the calculated result, which can be used as output in subsequent nodes.

**Examples**

* Calculate the sum of two numbers: `Calculator.sum(2, 3)`
* Convert inches to centimeters: `Calculator.convert("inches", "centimeters", 10)`
* Calculate the mean of a list of numbers: `Calculator.mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`

**Troubleshooting**

* Check that the input values are valid and in the correct format.
* Verify that the calculation type is correctly specified.
* Review the integration logs for any errors or warnings.

**Limitations**

* The Calculator integration does not support complex calculations involving multiple variables or equations.
* Some advanced mathematical functions may require additional setup or configuration.

By integrating the Calculator with your workflow automation software, you can streamline your workflows and automate repetitive calculations, freeing up more time to focus on higher-level tasks.

## Actions
- **Modulo**: The Modulo integration action allows you to perform arithmetic operations on numeric values within your workflow. You can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers and store the result in a variable. This action is useful when you need to manipulate data or calculate totals within your automated process. ([Documentation]([Modulo](actions/modulo.md)))

- **Multiply**: Multiplies two input values together and returns the result. ([Documentation]([Multiply](actions/multiply.md)))

- **Add**: Adds one or more items to a specified collection or list within your workflow. This action is useful when you need to append new data to an existing dataset or update a list of values in your workflow. ([Documentation]([Add](actions/add.md)))

- **Subtract**: Subtracts one or more values from another value in a specified field, allowing you to perform arithmetic operations and manipulate data within your workflows. ([Documentation]([Subtract](actions/subtract.md)))

- **Divide**: Splits an input array or string into multiple equal parts based on a specified number of segments. ([Documentation]([Divide](actions/divide.md)))
