# OpenAI Embeddings Action

Generate vector embeddings for semantic understanding of text content.

## Key Features
- **Semantic Search**: Find similar content based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple texts in a single API call
- **Auto-Chunking**: Automatically split large texts with configurable overlap
- **Dimension Control**: Optimize vector size for performance vs accuracy
- **Multiple Models**: Support for different embedding models based on needs

## Use Cases
- Build knowledge bases with semantic search
- Find similar support tickets or documents
- Content deduplication and clustering
- Customer feedback analysis
- RAG system implementation
- Recommendation systems

## Models Available
- **text-embedding-3-small**: Efficient, lower cost (1536 dimensions default)
- **text-embedding-3-large**: Higher accuracy (3072 dimensions default)
- **text-embedding-ada-002**: Legacy model (1536 dimensions)

## Best Practices
- Use chunking for texts over 8000 tokens
- Store embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval
- Use cosine similarity for comparing embeddings
- Consider dimension reduction for large-scale applications
