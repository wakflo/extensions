# Unsubscriber

## Description

The Unsubscriber integration trigger is designed to automatically remove subscribers from your workflow when they unsubscribe from a specific email list or service. This trigger can be used in conjunction with other automation workflows to ensure that unsubscribed contacts are no longer targeted for marketing campaigns, surveys, or other automated tasks. By integrating the Unsubscriber trigger with your existing workflows, you can maintain data accuracy and compliance with anti-spam laws by promptly removing unsubscribed contacts from your workflow.
